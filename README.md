# 2021-09_NWCHEM_to_MicrosoftBroombridge
Initial setup &amp; scaling test on the NWCHEM -> Microsoft Broombridge YAML 2e- generation

## NWCHEM

You need at least version 7.0 .

> conda install -c conda-forge nwchem

Works fine 2021-09-14 .

( The generated YAML mentions NWCHEM 6.8, but this is just inherited from the Schema. Version 6.8 does not seem to contain the code to print out the 2e- integrals)

## NWCHEM run file

You do a standard Hartree-Fock (SCF) calculation. 
The 2e- integrals are then generated by the 'Tensor Contraction Engine' (TCE) block, which is also capable of doing CCSD/CIS/MP2 & related post-HF methods. 

```
tce
  CCSD 

  2eorb
  2emet 13
  tilesize 1

  thresh 1.0d-8
  maxiter 150
  nroots 1 
end

set tce_init:QC T

set tce:print_integrals T
set tce:qorb 6 
set tce:qela 2 
set tce:qelb 2

task tce energy
```

Is the standard approach, which also does a CCSD calculation, which is then extracted as a 'good guess' for the quantum calculation along with the CCSD energy.

## TODO

 - [ ] Scaling test
 - [ ] Edit Python file to accept perturbation-theory originating 2e- integrals
 - [ ] Understand the NWCHEM failure when outputing MBPT2 methods; not able to print something?
